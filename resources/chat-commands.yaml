    Every Thursday I'll be live-coding https://github.com/htm-community/building-htm-systems, 
    which is a WIP interactive document on Building HTM Systems. We'll be converting existing 
    encoder docs into a stand-alone server using React and Next in Node JS. 
    We'll also be hand-coding the Spatial Pooling and Temporal Memory algorithms of HTM.

    You're watching a live Numenta research meeting. These meetings have always been

    meetings on Twitch. This is how scientific research is done at Numenta.
